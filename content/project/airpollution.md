We are interested in the effects of air pollution on the Retina.

In order to do this we have geocoded all our participants' addresses using the 
<a href="https://geoservices.tamu.edu">
    Geocoder provided by Texas A&M University GeoServices
</a> which takes addresses and returns latitude/longtitude
